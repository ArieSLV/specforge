## Current Focus

| Area | Status | Next action |
|---|---|---|
| Specification scaffold | Draft | Established 2026-05-25; serves as package entry point |
| Stage 0 decisions | **Complete** | All 8 of 8 approved 2026-05-28 (DEC-001..DEC-008). Foundation locked: distribution, configuration, runtime, ID scheme, skill packaging, schema versioning, MVP tool set, instruction layer. |
| Stage 1 items | **Complete** | All 13 of 13 approved 2026-05-28 (ITEM-001..ITEM-013). Specs locked: scaffold + config + IDs + skill machinery + bootstrap-and-authoring tools (5 categories of MCP tools) + validation + error envelope + 7 SKILL.md content (catalog amended from 6 to 7 post-audit) + docs. 21 MCP tools across 6 categories. 14 error codes. 12 typed Core exceptions. |
| Stage 2 implementation | **In progress** | ITEM-001 (bootstrap) implemented — CMT-001 (`13a306d`). ITEM-002 (config model + MCP host + 3 tools) **implemented** 2026-05-29 — CMT-002 (`284e3be`), all 8 Done Criteria met; MCP host live on `ModelContextProtocol.Core` 1.3.0; 35 tests pass; self-review agent clean. 2 of 13 items done. Next: ITEM-003 (ID validator — Core-only). |
| Stage 3 first external adoption | Not started | Awaits Stage 2 completion (or at least a runnable MVP binary). |

## Active Blockers

_None._ ITEM-001 and ITEM-002 implemented and committed. Build env notes (persist across all Stage 2 builds): (1) inherited `MSBuildSDKsPath` (RavenDB toolchain, pins SDK 8.0.403) must be cleared per build invocation (`$env:MSBuildSDKsPath = $null; dotnet build ...`) so `global.json`'s .NET 10 pin takes effect — otherwise NETSDK1045; (2) `dotnet` commands must run with cwd inside `D:\Work\specforge` (the RavenDB sibling repo's `global.json` pins an uninstalled 10.0.300). Next item: ITEM-003.
